# 🧠 VibeSRM Prompt History (VibeCraft Hackathon)

This document contains a curated list of the core prompts used during the development of **VibeSRM** by **Team Bug Sneaker**. These prompts were used to guide the **Antigravity AI Agent** in creating the premium, "non-AI" aesthetic and complex realtime logic.

## 🎨 Phase 1: High-Fidelity UI Overhaul

**Prompt:**
> "Now, I want to completely overhaul the ChatView component. I don't want it to look like a standard AI chat. I want a 'Top-Notch', ultra-premium aesthetic. Use a 'Glass & Neon' design with:
> 1. Floating UI elements (detached from edges).
> 2. Holographic glass message bubbles with reflections.
> 3. An atmospheric background (midnight blue with moving ambient light orbs).
> 4. Micro-interactions for every hover/click.
> Make it feel alive, distinct, and high-end."

## 🌐 Phase 2: Social Nexus & Community Pulse

**Prompt:**
> "The social section is currently too basic. Enhance it to match the premium 'Vibe' of the chat. Use a 'Bento Grid' masonry layout for the squad members and upcoming vibes. Add:
> 1. Trending tags with a marquee effect.
> 2. Interest badges for squad members with glowing hover rings.
> 3. An 'Upcoming Events' stream with blurred glass cards.
> Use the existing design system (aurora, glass-card) to ensure it looks hand-crafted, not generic."

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Architecture & System Sync

**Prompt:**
> "Ensure the entire app is fully reactive. When a user joins a 'Vibe' in the Dashboard, the ChatView must instantly update to show that event's specific channel. Use Supabase Realtime to synchronize message state and occupancy counts across all connected clients. Optimize the layout for both wide desktop and mobile-responsive views."

## 📝 Phase 4: Final Polish & Documentation

**Prompt:**
> "I am submitting this project for a hackathon. I need the README to be stunning. Add a problem statement, a Mermaid architecture diagram, and detailed build instructions. Mention that we are Team Bug Sneaker. Include the app logo (src/Logo.png) and make sure the feature descriptions sound visionary and premium."

### *Strategy Summary:*
Our prompting strategy focused on **semantic aesthetic alignment**. Instead of providing raw code instructions, we used high-level design terminology (e.g., *"backdrop blur"*, *"concurrent rendering"*, *"dynamic island vibe"*) to allow the AI to choose the best implementation patterns within the React 19 and Framer Motion ecosystem.
